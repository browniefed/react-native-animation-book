# Clamp

With clamp we will control how `Animated` extrapolates. The definition of extrapolation actually explains extrapolation really well.... go figure.

```
extrapolation is the process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable.
```

Extrapolation is default to `extend` on in `Animated`
