# Gatsby Docs Starter 

#### This Project was forked from [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter)

A starter skeleton with advanced features for [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/).

Developed for creating Documentation or Tutorial websites.

### [Demo](https://gatsby-docs-starter.netlify.com/)

This template provides everything but the content. You could just write all your lessons in markdown files, configure a few lines of code, and have a completely built documentation website.
