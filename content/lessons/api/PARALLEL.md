# Animated.parallel

The `parallel` call will have all defined animations in the array trigger at the same time.

```js
this._opacityAnimationValue = new Animated.Value(1);
this._moveAnimationValue = new Animated.ValueXY();


Animated.parallel([
	Animated.timing(this._moveAnimationValue, {
		toValue: 100,
		duration: 500
	}),
	Animated.timing(this._opacityAnimationValue, {
		toValue: 0,
		duration: 200
	})
]).start()

<Animated.View style={{opacity: this._opacityAnimationValue, transform: this._moveAnimationValue.getTranslateTransform()}} />
```

Our example here we have 2 animations. One that will control opacity, and the other movement ( or in our case translateX/translateY).

The first animation will move the View from `x: 0, y: 0` to `x: 100, y: 100`.
At the same time our second animation will kick off and it will fade out the opacity from `1` to `0`.

So the `Animated.View` will move and fade out at the same time.
